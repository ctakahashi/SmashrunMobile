Mobile app of Smashrun website

Smashrun: a web-based analytical dashboard for runners that helps to uncover interesting correlations between training habits and performance over time.

This is an Android app that uses the Smashrun API to display data for a user. 
Currently, it displays distance, time, pace, weather, and other information for a given run in a clean interface.

Created during the Brandeis Codestellation Hackathon 2015.
